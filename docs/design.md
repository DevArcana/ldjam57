# Ship

The ship consists of:

- reactor - produces power and heat
- life support - uses power to produce oxygen
- scavenge station - uses power to collect scrap
- engines - use power to propel the ship
- sonar - uses power to scan the surroundings
- light - uses power to illuminate the ship

## Reactor

The reactor can operate sustainably at about 50% power.
Above that its temperature will start raising.
Cold exterior waters will increase this operational capacity but warm currents will decrease it.

Each system can draw up to a few units of power max.

- life support: 3
- scavenge station: 3
- engines: 5
- sonar: 3
- light: 1

Total power consumption can reach 15 units.
At nominal exterior temperature the reactor should be able to output 10 units of power.

- life support: 3
- scavenge station: 1
- engines: 3
- sonar: 2
- light: 1
