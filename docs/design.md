# Mechanics

There are five basic resources:

- power
- temperature
- oxygen
- hull integrity
- scrap

# Modules

## Helm

Requires power to operate the ship and sonar.

Engines:
- forward/backward
- yaw
- ascent/descent

Sonar:
- power

## Reactor

Generates power from hopes and dreams.

Temperature rises with more power generation.
Can explode if too hot.
Cooling required to cool it down.
Wasted power bars increase temperature.

## Cooling

Turns power into freezing.

If too much power provided, it will chill down the ship too much and you will freeze.

## Life Support

Oxygen from power.

Fires consume more oxygen.

Requires constant power of some values to keep oxygen fully at 100%.

## Scrap Retrieval

Console that requires small amount of power for 5s to retrieve scrap.

Optional mini-game to retrieve scrap via controlling some hand.
